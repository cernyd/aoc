# aoc (Advent of Code)
This repository contains my Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com) solutions.

## 2022
I decided to learn Rust in this years AoC. Be aware that the solutions
may be overcomplicated and not optimal as I am still learning Rust. The goal of the implementations was to try out as many Rust features as possible.
I got to day 8 during AoC 2022, after that school and work deadlines made me stop. Spent most of the time fighting with Rust safety, not actually solving the problems.

## 2023
This time I decided to use Python, my main language. Mainly because I would like to win this time and the challenge will be hard enough even without using a language unknown to me.
